# Shared Repository for Emolument Tables

This folder stores tables of notary emolument values extracted from PDFs.  
Each state's table should be pasted between markers:

```
---INÍCIO [ESTADO]---
<content of the table>
---FIM [ESTADO]---
```

I will store each table in a separate file for analysis.
